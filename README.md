## 😤 WHAT IS THIS??

Are you tired of **HIGH DEFINITION**? Do you hate **CLARITY**?  
Does your content contain too many **PIXELS THAT MAKE SENSE**?

**THE DEEP FRYER 3000** is a single-file, client-side weapon of mass destruction that turns your clean, wholesome images into **cursed digital garbage** using the raw power of the HTML5 Canvas API. 

NO SERVERS. NO PYTHON. NO MERCY. JUST MATH AND PAIN.

## 🛠️ FEATURES (THE RECIPE)

*   **SIZZLE SLIDER:** Cranks saturation until colors bleed into the 4th dimension.
*   **CRUNCH CONTROL:** Increases contrast until the void consumes the shadows.
*   **OIL OVERLAY:** Applies a mathematically generated "grease" filter using randomized noise algorithms.
*   **JPEG DECAY ENGINE:** Simulates reposting an image 50,000 times by forcing the browser to re-encode the canvas at `0.01` quality. **IT'S CRUNCHY.**
