## 😤 WHAT IS THIS?

Do you hate pixels? Do you think high-definition images are for nerds? Do you want your memes to look like they've been screenshotted 4,000 times, emailed to a Nokia 3310, and then microwaved?

**YOU HAVE FOUND THE HOLY GRAIL.**

This is a **self-contained, single-file HTML website** that utilizes the HTML5 Canvas API to scientifically destroy images. No servers. No AI. Just pure mathematical degradation.

## 🛠️ FEATURES (THE RECIPE)

*   **SIZZLE (Saturation):** Cranks colors until your eyes bleed.
*   **CRUNCH (Contrast):** Removes all nuance. Black is void. White is the sun.
*   **OIL (Noise):** Adds random pixel grain to simulate dirty screens.
*   **DECAY (JPEG Artifacts):** The secret sauce. It forces the browser to save the image at `0.01` quality and re-renders it to simulate "Bit Rot."
